> This is a simple Todo-App written in Django and hosted on replit.

## How does it work
This application allows anonymous users to create, edit or delete various todo notes. It uses Django on the back end, and html, CSS, Javascript on the front end.
I used Django as the back end of my first app simply because I wanted to learn more about it. I think I will write more apps with it in the future, stay tuned!
I faced some troubles on the front end side and the app isn't 100 % polished but I'm proud that it's working without issues. In the future I'd like to implement users with login.
